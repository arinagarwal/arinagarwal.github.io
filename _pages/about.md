Hi! I am Arin Agarwal, a passionate engineering student at the UW Seattle hoping to major in Computer Engineering. Outside of school, I love eating, cooking, working out, and playing basketball.

I am currently a Software/ Machine Learning intern at SvaDhruthi, and work to make healthcare more accessible to people in rural Indian communities.

I am also always working on projects! Currently I am working on a Chrome extension to help with everyday cooking!

Feel free to reach out to me through email, <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/arinagarwal/'>linkedin</a>, or instagram!
