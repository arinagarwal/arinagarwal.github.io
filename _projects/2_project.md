This project connected me to the muslim community, and helped me make lots of new friends at UW!
Additionally, I learned react.js, html, and bootstrap framework. You can check out the website <a href='https://msauw.org/'>here</a>
   



Here are my favorite pages that I worked on!

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/MSA_AboutPage.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/MSA_Gallery.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
